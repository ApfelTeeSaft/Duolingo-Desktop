# Duolingo-Desktop
a desktop executable for duolingo

# How to Compile into Executable
open a cmd window then go to the directory where you downloaded the repo, and type "python compiler.py build"
you need the following libs, wxPython and cx-Freeze
but you can find a precompiled version in releases :D

# Problems
you cant login using Facebook or Google sadly, and it also doesnt save your login credentials :(
